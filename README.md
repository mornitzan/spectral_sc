# spectral_sc

This code is accompanying the manuscript 'Revealing lineage-related signals in single-cell gene expression using random matrix theory' by Mor Nitzan and Michael Brenner.

The file models.py contains the code for simulating the independent profiles, lineage model and regulatory interactions model (and their associated eigenvalue distribution).

The file data_analysis.py contains the code for analyzing single-cell data. As an example, it follows the analysis of single-cell epidermis data generated by [Joost, et al., Cell Syst 3, 221â€“237.e9 (2016)].
